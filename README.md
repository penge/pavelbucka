Hello! This is my portfolio page!

It is simple.

And it is done in modern approach.

## Details

Source files can be found in the `./app` folder.

These are compiled and minified into the `./dist` folder, using **gulp**.

#### package.json

Defines the required dependencies.

They can be installed using **npm**, following this command:

```sh
$ npm install
```

#### gulpfile.js

This is the file that defines gulp tasks, and loads necessary packages to make it happen.

Interesting packages are **browser-sync** or **browserify**.

Default task is the only one needed and can be run using:

```sh
$ gulp
```

It will automatically watch for changes in any of application files.
